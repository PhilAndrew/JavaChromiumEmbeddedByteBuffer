JavaChromiumEmbeddedByteBuffer
==============================

Renders into Java ByteBuffer.

This project is looking for someone to grow it into a much more usable library for JMonkeyEngine.
So please use this code to do so.

Java Chromium Embedded renders a browser to a Java ByteBuffer, this is useful for a game engine such as JMonkeyEngine. http://jmonkeyengine.org/

Here is also included TestCameraMotionPath2.scala.txt which is Scala source for TestCameraMotionPath2 which is included with JMonkeyEngine as an example. Well its in Java when it comes with JMonkeyEngine but here I supplied a modified version in Scala which used Chromium Embedded Framework.
