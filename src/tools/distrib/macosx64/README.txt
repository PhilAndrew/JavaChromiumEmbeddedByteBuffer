Java Chromium Embedded Framework (JCEF) Binary Distribution for Mac OS X 64-bit
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This distribution contains all components necessary to build and distribute a
Java application using JCEF on the Mac OS X platform. Please see the LICENSING
section of this document for licensing terms and conditions.


CONTENTS
--------

bin         Contains the jcef_app whose contents include Java archives and
            native library files.

docs        Contains documentation for the org.cef package.

tests       Contains the MainFrame sample application.

USAGE
-----

1. Install a 64-bit version of the Oracle Java 7 runtime.
2. Launch jcef_app to run the MainFrame sample application.
3. Optionally recompile the sample application and update jcef-tests.jar
   in the jcef_app bundle by running the compile.sh script.

Please visit the JCEF Website for additional usage information.

REDISTRIBUTION
--------------

This binary distribution contains the below components. Components listed under
the "required" section must be redistributed with all applications using JCEF.
Components listed under the "optional" section may be excluded if the related
features will not be used.

The native components of JCEF are distributed as an app bundle (jcef_app) with
the following structure:

jcef_app.app/
  Contents/
    Frameworks/
      Chromium Embedded Framework.framework/
        Libraries/
          ffmpegsumo.so <= HTML5 audio/video support library
          libcef.dylib <= CEF core library
        Resources/
          cef.pak, devtools_resources.pak <= non-localized resources and strings
          en.lproj/, ... <= locale-specific resources and strings
      libplugin_carbon_interpose.dylib <= plugin support library
      jcef Helper.app/
        Contents/
          Info.plist
          MacOS/
            jcef Helper <= helper executable

      GenericApp.icns

The "Chromium Embedded Framework.framework" is an unversioned framework that
contains CEF binaries and resources. The "jcef Helper" apps are used for
executing separate processes (renderer, plugin, etc) with different
characteristics.

Required components:

* Java archives
    jcef.jar
    gluegen-rt.jar
    gluegen-rt-natives-macosx-universal.jar
    jogl-all.jar
    jogl-all-natives-macosx-universal.jar

* CEF core library
    Chromium Embedded Framework.framework/Libraries/libcef.dylib

* Plugin support library
    libplugin_carbon_interpose.dylib

* Cursor resources
    Chromium Embedded Framework.framework/Resources/*.png
    Chromium Embedded Framework.framework/Resources/*.tiff

* CEF JNI library
    libjcef.dylib

Optional components:

* Localized resources
    Chromium Embedded Framework.framework/Resources/*.lproj/
  Note: Contains localized strings for WebKit UI controls. A .pak file is loaded
  from this folder based on the CefSettings.locale value. Only configured
  locales need to be distributed. If no locale is configured the default locale
  of "en" will be used. Locale file loading can be disabled completely using
  CefSettings.pack_loading_disabled.

* Other resources
    Chromium Embedded Framework.framework/Resources/cef.pak
    Chromium Embedded Framework.framework/Resources/devtools_resources.pak
  Note: Contains WebKit image and inspector resources. Pack file loading can be
  disabled completely using CefSettings.pack_loading_disabled. The resources
  directory path can be customized using CefSettings.resources_dir_path.

* FFmpeg audio and video support
    Chromium Embedded Framework.framework/Libraries/ffmpegsumo.so
  Note: Without this component HTML5 audio and video will not function.
